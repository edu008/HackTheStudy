{"flashcards": [{"id": 1, "question": "What is the main focus of the first lecture in Economics at Bern University of Applied Sciences?", "answer": "The main focus is on creating demand and supply curves, understanding opportunity costs, graphically showing the effects of shifts in demand and supply, and calculating the elasticity of quantity demanded to price changes."}, {"id": 2, "question": "What are opportunity costs in economics?", "answer": "Opportunity costs refer to the benefits one misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. For example, the opportunity cost of work is leisure, and the opportunity cost of producing product X is not being able to produce product Y."}, {"id": 3, "question": "How is economic cost calculated?", "answer": "Economic cost is the sum of direct cost and opportunity cost. For example, attending a Taylor Swift concert has a direct cost of 160, an opportunity cost of 40, making the economic cost 200."}, {"id": 4, "question": "What is economic rent?", "answer": "Economic rent is the net benefit minus the opportunity cost. If the net benefit of an activity is greater than the opportunity cost, the economic rent is positive, indicating a profitable decision."}, {"id": 5, "question": "What is price elasticity of demand?", "answer": "Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good changes when its price changes. It is elastic if demand changes by more than the percentage change in price, inelastic if less, and unit elastic if equal."}, {"id": 6, "question": "How does dynamic pricing work?", "answer": "Dynamic pricing involves adjusting the price of a product based on current demand levels. For instance, ski resorts may change prices according to the number of visitors."}, {"id": 7, "question": "What is consumer surplus?", "answer": "Consumer surplus is the difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual market price they pay, representing the consumer's perceived benefit or bargain."}, {"id": 8, "question": "What is price discrimination and its types?", "answer": "Price discrimination involves charging different prices for the same product based on consumer characteristics. The three degrees are individual pricing, quantity-based pricing, and grouping consumers."}, {"id": 9, "question": "How can the opportunity cost of attending university be calculated?", "answer": "The opportunity cost of attending university includes tuition fees, book costs, and the income foregone by not working full-time, which could be 48,000 CHF a year in a basic office job."}, {"id": 10, "question": "What factors influence the elasticity of demand for a product?", "answer": "Factors include the availability of substitutes, necessity vs luxury nature of the product, proportion of income spent on the good, and the time period considered. For example, apples compared to pears or cabbages, or petrol over different time frames."}], "test_questions": [{"id": 1, "text": "What is opportunity cost in the context of economics?", "options": ["The financial cost of choosing one option over another", "The benefit gained from choosing the best alternative", "The cost of resources used in production", "The benefit lost when choosing one alternative over another"], "correctAnswer": 3, "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the benefit that is foregone by choosing one alternative over another. It represents the value of the next best option that is not chosen."}, {"id": 2, "text": "If a Taylor Swift concert ticket costs 160 CHF and you would be willing to pay 260 CHF, what is your net benefit?", "options": ["260 CHF", "160 CHF", "100 CHF", "40 CHF"], "correctAnswer": 2, "explanation": "The net benefit is calculated as the maximum amount you are willing to pay minus the actual cost, which is 260 - 160 = 100 CHF."}, {"id": 3, "text": "What is the economic cost of attending a Taylor Swift concert if it costs 160 CHF and you could earn 40 CHF by playing in a jazz club?", "options": ["160 CHF", "200 CHF", "100 CHF", "60 CHF"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "The economic cost includes both the direct cost and the opportunity cost. Here, it is 160 CHF (ticket cost) + 40 CHF (opportunity cost of not playing) = 200 CHF."}, {"id": 4, "text": "How is price elasticity of demand defined when a 10% change in price leads to a more than 10% change in quantity demanded?", "options": ["Inelastic", "Elastic", "Unit elastic", "Perfectly elastic"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "If a price change leads to a greater than proportional change in quantity demanded, the demand is considered elastic, meaning elasticity > 1."}, {"id": 5, "text": "What is the opportunity cost of producing 24,000 iThings if an economy can also produce 25,200 Instawidgets?", "options": ["25,200 Instawidgets", "1.05 Instawidgets per iThing", "24,000 iThings", "1 Instawidget per iThing"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "The opportunity cost of producing one iThing in terms of Instawidgets is calculated as the total Instawidgets forgone divided by the total iThings produced, which is 25,200/24,000 = 1.05 Instawidgets per iThing."}, {"id": 6, "text": "What concept describes the allocation of limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants in economics?", "options": ["Supply and demand", "Opportunity cost", "Scarcity", "Elasticity"], "correctAnswer": 2, "explanation": "Scarcity refers to the basic economic problem that resources are limited while wants are infinite."}, {"id": 7, "text": "In the context of opportunity costs, what is the opportunity cost of choosing to work?", "options": ["The income from work", "The leisure time forgone", "The cost of working materials", "The benefit of working"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "The opportunity cost of choosing to work is the leisure time that is given up."}, {"id": 8, "text": "If the price of pears decreases, how would this affect the demand for apples according to the content?", "options": ["Increase the demand for apples", "Decrease the demand for apples", "No change in demand for apples", "Increase the price of apples"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "A decrease in the price of a substitute good like pears would typically decrease the demand for apples."}, {"id": 9, "text": "What is the basic concept of economics related to the allocation of resources?", "options": ["Utility", "Scarcity", "Demand", "Supply"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "Scarcity refers to the basic economic problem that arises because resources are limited while human wants are unlimited."}, {"id": 10, "text": "What does the concept of opportunity cost refer to in economics?", "options": ["The total cost of producing a good", "The benefit lost when choosing one alternative over another", "The revenue gained from selling goods", "The price paid for a good"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is given up when making a decision."}, {"id": 11, "text": "If a Taylor Swift concert ticket costs 160 CHF and you would be willing to pay 260 CHF, what is your net benefit?", "options": ["40 CHF", "60 CHF", "100 CHF", "160 CHF"], "correctAnswer": 2, "explanation": "The net benefit is calculated as the difference between what you are willing to pay and what you actually pay, which is 260 CHF - 160 CHF = 100 CHF."}, {"id": 12, "text": "What is opportunity cost in the context of economics?", "options": ["The benefit gained from all alternatives", "The benefit lost when choosing one alternative over another", "The total cost of all alternatives", "The cost of the chosen alternative"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "Opportunity cost refers to the benefits or value that are foregone by choosing one option over another."}, {"id": 13, "text": "If a Taylor Swift concert ticket costs 160 CHF and you would be willing to pay 260 CHF, what is your net benefit?", "options": ["60 CHF", "100 CHF", "160 CHF", "200 CHF"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "Net benefit is calculated as the difference between what you are willing to pay and what you actually pay, which is 260 - 160 = 100 CHF."}, {"id": 14, "text": "What is the economic cost of attending a Taylor Swift concert if it costs 160 CHF and you could earn 40 CHF by playing in a jazz club?", "options": ["160 CHF", "200 CHF", "180 CHF", "220 CHF"], "correctAnswer": 1, "explanation": "Economic cost includes both direct costs and opportunity costs, so 160 + 40 = 200 CHF."}], "analysis": {"content_type": "study_material", "topics": [], "estimated_flashcards": 1, "estimated_questions": 1}}
