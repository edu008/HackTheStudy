{"flashcards": [{"id": 1, "question": "What are the motivations for governments intervening in markets?", "answer": "Governments intervene in markets for various reasons, including correcting market failures, redistributing income, and promoting economic stability."}, {"id": 2, "question": "What are price floors and how do they affect the market?", "answer": "Price floors are government-imposed limits on how low a price can be charged for a product. They can lead to surpluses if set above the equilibrium price, as supply exceeds demand."}, {"id": 3, "question": "What are price ceilings and how do they affect the market?", "answer": "Price ceilings are government-imposed limits on how high a price can be charged for a product. They can lead to shortages if set below the equilibrium price, as demand exceeds supply."}, {"id": 4, "question": "How can minimum wages affect unemployment according to the discussed content?", "answer": "The content suggests that increasing minimum wages, as seen in Britain, may not necessarily lead to higher unemployment, challenging traditional economic arguments."}, {"id": 5, "question": "What is tax incidence and how does it affect consumers and producers?", "answer": "Tax incidence refers to the distribution of the tax burden between consumers and producers. It depends on the price elasticity of supply and demand."}, {"id": 6, "question": "How do direct and indirect taxes differ?", "answer": "Direct taxes are levied directly on income or wealth, while indirect taxes are levied on goods and services, shifting the tax burden to consumers."}, {"id": 7, "question": "How might a minimum wage actually increase company productivity?", "answer": "A minimum wage might increase company productivity by motivating workers, reducing turnover, and enhancing job satisfaction, leading to more efficient operations."}, {"id": 8, "question": "What are subsidies and how do they affect market prices?", "answer": "Subsidies are financial aid provided by the government to reduce the cost of production or consumption. They can lower market prices and increase demand."}, {"id": 9, "question": "What should be considered when deciding what to tax?", "answer": "Considerations include the impact on economic welfare, the ability to pay principle, and the potential for tax revenue without causing significant market distortions."}, {"id": 10, "question": "What does the triangle B,C,D represent in the context of subsidies?", "answer": "The triangle B,C,D represents the deadweight loss in a market when subsidies are applied, indicating inefficiencies and loss of total economic welfare."}, {"id": 11, "question": "What are the motivations for governments intervening in markets?", "answer": "Governments intervene in markets for various reasons, including correcting market failures, redistributing income, and promoting economic stability."}, {"id": 12, "question": "What are price floors and how do they affect the market?", "answer": "Price floors are government-imposed limits on how low a price can be charged for a product.
