Economics –lecture 1
Demand and supply, trade offs and the basics of micro 
economics
▶BFH Business School, Institute of Sustainable Business
Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école spécialisée bernoise | Bern University ofApplied SciencesAfter today’s (and next week’s) lecture you will 
-have created a demand and supply curve
-understood opportunity costs
-be able to show graphically the effects of shifts in demand 
and supply-calculate sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes 
(elasticity)
Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école spécialisée bernoise | Bern University ofApplied Sciences▶As with many things in lifethere aretrade -offs
▶Work / Leisure
▶Produce X / Produce Y
▶Expand here / Expand thereEconomics –theallocation of«scarce » resources toour
«infinite» wants.

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école spécialisée bernoise | Bern University ofApplied Sciences▶A Taylor Swift concert in Zürich costs 160
▶Youarea Swifty , howmuch would youbewilling to payfortheconcert ?
Let’s say: 260. 
Cost 160 Benefit 260 
Net benefit 100
But youcould beplaying your synthesizer in a small jazz club thatnight and earn
40. 
▶Opportunity cost ofTS concert is40. 
▶Economic cost: direct cost+ opportunity cost= 160+40 = 200
Decision rule: Economic costvsbenefit (200 < 260 ; cost< benefit ) Go Swifty ! 
▶Economic rent: Net benefit -opportunity cost
Decision rule: economic rent> 0 (100- 40 =60; rent> 0) GetSwifty in here! Opportunity cost, economic cost, economic rent

year at unifor a student on full time programme . The student could earn full 
time 48,000 CHfa year in a basic office job. Assume that the student can work 
part-time in the office for 3 months of the year (pro rata).

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école spécialisée bernoise | Bern University ofApplied SciencesLet’s create a demand curve
Demand
1. stand up if you eat apples
2.You will bid for an apple . 
3. Look at the Excel spreadsheet this will display  the 
price  of an apple
4. When the price  has risen  above  the price  you are 
willing  to pay sit down  
5. The rest wait  to be countedSource: https://www.littlezurichkitchen.ch/swiss -apple- day/
Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesLet’s create a supply curve
Supply
1. Imagine you have  an apple  and someone  wants  
to buy it.
2. You will be asked  to sell your  apple
3. Look at the market  price  on the Excel 
spreadsheet
4. When the price  has fallen below  the price  you 
are willing  to receive for the apple  sit down  
5. The rest wait  to be countedSource: https://www.littlezurichkitchen.ch/swiss -apple- day/
Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesWe now have our demand and supply curves
A rapper – Probably called Lil Something or $ 
whatever.Look at the space between the market price and the 
demand curve. Think about hat what that represents for all the people who were willing to pay more than the market price.
Consider what would happen….
▶if I offered you an organic apple
▶if the price of pears decreases 
▶if there are not enough insects to pollinate the apples
▶if Micheal Jordan teams up with Mala Yousafazi , Taylor 
Swift, Kim Kardashian, Billie Eillish , the Dellai Lama and 
Dave Grohl start promoting apples
How would you represent all these things on our supply 
and demand diagram? 

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesConsumer surplus  – That  bargain feeling
Reference – Mankiw chp 7

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesPrice discrimination  – Mankiw p253 5e - 
Price discrimination  – different prices  according  to different characteristics  of the consumer
3 degrees  of price  discrimination  
(not mentioned  in Mankiw – but 
all over  the internet ) 
1st degree – 
individual prices  for 
each  consumer
2nd degree – 
Based  on quantity  
3rd degree – grouping

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesMeasuring  sensitivity  to price  changes

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesChanges  in price , changes  in other goods ’ prices , changes  
in income  – how  much  does Q change ?
▶What  happens  if the price  of apples  
falls, how much  more  will be bought ?
▶What  happens  if the price  of petrol  
increases ? How much  less will be 
bought ?
▶What  happens  if income  increases ? 
How will the demand  for bus journies  
change ?
▶What  happens  if the price  of flights  
increases ? How much  will the demand  
for night  trains  change ?
Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesPrice elasticity  of demand
Diagram Source -https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/elasticity -of-demand/5 -types -of-price -elasticity -of-demand -explained/3509▶Change price 10% ; demand changes by >10%  = 
Elastic  ; Elasticity >1
▶Change price 10% ; demand changes < 10%  = Inelastic ; Elasticity < 1
▶Change price 10% : demand changes 10%  = Unit elastic ; Elasticity = 1
WATCH OUT!! –The PED is usually negative but it is 
reported in most places in an absolute value. ¦ ¦

Berner Fachhochschule | Haute école  spécialisée  bernoise  | Bern University of Applied SciencesWhat  influences  PED? ( what makes  it more  or less elastic ) 
Compare  the two goods  and think  about  their elasticities
▶Apples with respect  to pears , kiwi 
fruit, cabbages  ___________________
▶Bread  and croissants ________________
▶Yoghurt  vs strawberry  yoghurt   
_____________▶Commuting  costs for poorer  and 
richer _________________________
▶Petrol over 1 year, 5 years , 10 years
